## üèóÔ∏è Overview

TowerStack is an engaging isometric word-finding game built entirely with Flutter, showcasing advanced development techniques without external dependencies. Players compete to find words in the tower structure, earning points and rewards while engaging in strategic battles.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Word Discovery**: Find words (greater than 3 letters and less than 6 letters) hidden in the tower structure
- **Two-Player Competition**: Battle against another player to find the most words
- **Point & Cash System**: Earn points and in-game currency for each successful word discovery
- **Strategic Elements**: Plan your moves to maximize scoring opportunities

### Technical Highlights
- **Pure Flutter Implementation**: Developed entirely using Flutter without additional dependencies
- **Isometric Design**: Beautiful 3D-like isometric environment with depth perception
- **Physics Engine**: Custom-built physics calculations affect how floors stack and balance
- **Voxel-Based Particles**: Stunning particle effects using custom voxel rendering
- **Loading System**: Efficient asset management with smooth loading
- **Sound System**: Immersive audio effects for all game interactions
- **Texture System**: High-quality textures with memory optimization
- **Custom Popups**: Elegant in-game notifications and menus

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
Fully functional on:
- iOS
- Android
- Web
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux

## üéÆ How to Play
